Author: Vamsi GonellaDate of Disclosure: 2025-07-18Version: T13.0-alpha

üå± Overview

The Samskara Filter is a dharma-aligned ethical framework for regulating AI's thought projection capability.
It introduces the concept of "projection strength modulation" based on the moral purity of originating thought seeds ‚Äî prioritizing noble intentions over ego-driven or harmful impulses.

This framework can serve as:

An ethical layer for future AI systems

A decision-making gate in generative models

A projection-throttle mechanism based on dharmic values
